title = "Material-Hijack";
description = "A utility that adds in a few lua hooks to make loading custom units and their textures easier. Instead of having to define a material file and have the proper shader nodes/files when building your mod bundle this mod will let you choose an in game material to apply to your custom unit and then replace that material's texture maps with your own.

To use this mod's functionality you will need to include several keys in your custom unit's data table. Currently only works for multiple meshes with a single material each or a single mesh with multiple materials and of course a single mesh with a single material. An example data block:
[code]data = {

	mat_slots = {
        slot1 = \"Spellbreaker\", //name of the material on your mesh
    	}
        //path name of the in game material you are hijcaking
	mat_to_use = \"units/weapons/player/wpn_emp_sword_02_t1/wpn_emp_sword_02_t1_3p\" 
    
    colors = {
        slot1 = \"textures/spellbreaker\" //path to the color map
    	}
    normals = {
        slot1 = \"textures/spellbreaker_n\" //path to the normal map
    	}
	MABs = {
        //path to the packed map; contains metal, roughness, and ambient occulsion in the RGBA channels
        slot1 = \"textures/spellbreaker_packed\",	
    	}
	
	//this are the names of the texture slots used by the hijacked material 
	color_slot = \"texture_map_c0ba2942\"
	norm_slot = \"texture_map_59cd86b9\"
	MAB_slot = \"texture_map_0205ba86\"
	emis_col_slot = \"texture_map_71d74d4d\"
	emis_det_slot = \"texture_map_ee282ea2\"
